/*
 The GCC constructor and destructor attributes

GCC has attributes with which you can tell the compiler about how a lot of
things should be handled by the compiler. Among such attributes the below
function attributes are used to define constructors and destructors in C
language. These would only work under GCC. As there is no objects and class
approach in C the working of these functions are not like C++ or other OOP
language constructor and destructors. With this feature, the functions defined
as constructor function would be executed before the function main starts to
execute, and the destructor would be executed after the main has finished
execution. The GCC function attributes to define constructors and destructors
are as follows:

__attribute__((constructor))
__attribute__((destructor))
__attribute__((constructor (PRIORITY)))
__attribute__((destructor (PRIORITY)))

For example, to declare a function named begin () as a constructor, and end ()
as a destructor, you need to tell gcc about these functions through the
following declaration.

void begin (void) __attribute__((constructor));
void end (void) __attribute__((destructor));

An alternate way to flag a function as a C constructor or destructor can also be
done at the time of the function definition.

__attribute__((constructor)) void begin (void)
{
 // Function Body
}
__attribute__((destructor)) void end (void)
{
 // Function Body
}

After declaring the functions as constructors and destructors as above, gcc will
automatically call begin () before calling main () and call end () after leaving
main or after the execution of exit () function. The following sample code
demonstrates the feature.


#include <stdio.h>

void begin (void) __attribute__((constructor));
void end (void) __attribute__((destructor));

int main (void)
{
  printf ("\nInside main ()");
}

void begin (void)
{
  printf ("\nIn begin ()");
}

void end (void)
{
  printf ("\nIn end ()\n");
}

Execution of this code will come up with an output which clearly shows how the
functions were executed.

In begin ()
Inside main ()
In end ()

Multiple Constructors and Destructors

Multiple constructors and destructors can be defined and can be automatically
executed depending upon their priority. In this case the syntax is
__attribute__((constructor (PRIORITY))) and __attribute__((destructor
(PRIORITY))). In this case the function prototypes would look like.

void begin_0 (void) __attribute__((constructor (101)));
void end_0 (void) __attribute__((destructor (101)));

void begin_1 (void) __attribute__((constructor (102)));
void end_1 (void) __attribute__((destructor (102)));

void begin_2 (void) __attribute__((constructor (103)));
void end_2 (void) __attribute__((destructor (103)));

The constructors with lower priority value would be executed first. The
destructors with higher priority value would be executed first. So the
constructors would be called in the sequence: begin_0, begin_1 (), begin_2 () .
and the destructors are called in the sequence end_2 (), end_1 (), end_0 ().
Note the LIFO execution sequence of the constructors and destructors depending
on the priority values.


The sample code below demonstrates this

#include <stdio.h>

void begin_0 (void) __attribute__((constructor (101)));
void end_0 (void) __attribute__((destructor (101)));

void begin_1 (void) __attribute__((constructor (102)));
void end_1 (void) __attribute__((destructor (102)));

void begin_2 (void) __attribute__((constructor (103)));
void end_2 (void) __attribute__((destructor (103)));

int main (void)
{
  printf ("\nInside main ()");
}

void begin_0 (void)
{
  printf ("\nIn begin_0 ()");
}

void end_0 (void)
{
  printf ("\nIn end_0 ()");
}

void begin_1 (void)
{
  printf ("\nIn begin_1 ()");
}

void end_1 (void)
{
  printf ("\nIn end_1 ()");
}

void begin_2 (void)
{
  printf ("\nIn begin_2 ()");
}

void end_2 (void)
{
  printf ("\nIn end_2 ()");
}

The output is as below:


In begin_0 ()
In begin_1 ()
In begin_2 ()
Inside main ()
In end_2 ()
In end_1 ()
In end_0 ()

Note that, when compiling with priority values between 0 and 100 (inclusive),
gcc would throw you warnings that the priority values from 0 to 100 are reserved
for implementation, so these values might be used internally that we might not
know. So it is better to use values out of this range. The value of the priority
does not depend, instead the relative values of the priority is the determinant
of the sequence of execution.

Note that the function main () is not the first function/code block to execute
in your code there are a lot of code already executed before main starts to
execute. The function main is the userâ€™s code entry point, but the program entry
point is not the main function. There is a startup function which prepares the
environment for the execution. The startup functions first call the functions
declared as constructors and then calls the main. When main returns the control
to the startup function it then calls those functions which you have declared as
the destructors. There are separate sections in the executable .ctors and .dtors
which hold these functions. (not discussed here).

As there is no class object creation in C language does not have such features
like in C++ or other OOP languages but this feature can bring some flexibility
by calling the functions automatically on execution and termination of the code
which you needed to do inside the main. For example one use may be like, you
have a dynamically allocated global variable, might point to a linked list head
or an array, or a file descriptor which you can allocate inside a constructor.
If some error is encountered you can immediately call exit () or the program
terminates normally, depending on the error code you can make cleanup in the
destructors.

Another good use is probably calling the initialization functions of some
library, a bunch of which needs to be called in each program. You can make a
separate file with the constructor files calling properly the library functions
(probably operating on globals) and calling the library cleanup functions in the
destructors. Whenever you make a program what you need to do is to compile your
code with this file containing the constructors and destructors and forget about
calling the initialization and cleanup functions in the main program. But doing
this will make your code unportable, as it would only work under GCC.
