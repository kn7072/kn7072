Custom config directory

You can change the Yazi configuration directory by exporting the YAZI_CONFIG_HOME environment variable. For example:

env "YAZI_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config/yazi-alt" yazi
env "YAZI_CONFIG_HOME=/home/stepan/.config/yazi" yazi

will start Yazi with ~/.config/yazi-alt as the configuration directory, and can have its own yazi.toml, keymap.toml, init.lua, etc. files within it.
