Having no strength to move; just five days left; a (some) Sasha came; on my
initiative; that is very kind of you; there was no use of waiting for him so long; it was
never clear to me; having studied in London for a few years; you are American, aren't
you?; how about having some tea?; and now it is time for you to leave; he was
supposed to stay at their place for a week; I decided to interrupt their conversation;
something like that; where do all these books come from?; I am not sure that I want
it; it seems like there was something in him; inside out; they were engaged; he was
employed; the question is only what people could (should) think; everyone was warned
to leave the school; he started to think over; didn't you happen to see the woman?;
that is exactly what we need; oh god! It will be a lesson to me; it is just a trifle; to
give twice more time for everything; if no one minds.
