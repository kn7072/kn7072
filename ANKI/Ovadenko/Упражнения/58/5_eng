You have no chance; for his sake; I don't want to stay any longer; he never said
anything worth paying attention to; what is the matter?; you must get him back; she
can earn her living; he was just about to talk about it; she won't harm even a fly;
I know it isn't your fault; he did his best to make it interesting for you; it suddenly
came to my head; by the name of Anna; the trouble is that...; how are you doing?;
everything looked the same; you'd better; he was shown into the room; what is this
park called?; this time; exactly at this time; that is what I want to do; something like
that; I don't want to trouble you again; the following days; where I got off and walked
to her house; it can't be you; he got into the car; how about having breakfast with
me; you never know when she will show up; and now it is time for you to leave.
