a) — Guess, what I have just done.
- You have just come into the room.
- OK. And besides that?
- I have no idea.
- Just don't get angry. I have broken your favourite vase.
- Good boy! I haven't expected anything better from you.
- What are going to do tomorrow?
b) — I am leaving for New York.
- From Minsk?
- No, from Warsaw.
- It is strange. Isn't it easier to leave from Minsk?
- I think it isn't. The ticket costs much cheaper from Warsaw.
- I see.
c) — You have recently come back from Canada, haven't you?
- Right, I have spent three years there.
- What did you like there?
- The people. They are very hospitable. And besides, it may seem strange to
you, the streets. They are very clean and even if you have your white jeans
on, you can easily sit down on the pavement and your jeans will remain
clean or almost clean.
