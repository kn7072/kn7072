work. 7. Our mother will have already cooked a cake by seven o'clock. We will all sit
at the table and drink tea. 8. There was nothing in the fridge. He did not know what

10. My brother has begun to learn the Italian language. He learns about 30 new
words every day. Yesterday when I came to him, he was also learning words. He said
that he had already learnt,20 words. If he learns about 30 words every day in a few
months he will be able to speak the Italian languagefluently. Tomorrow I will call
him at five o'clock. I am sure, he will also be learning words at this time. By the time
I call, he will have already learnt 20 words. - And what is he doing now? - He is
learning the words. 11. When I came to work, I remembered that I had left the book
at home. 12. I'd rather sleep now.
