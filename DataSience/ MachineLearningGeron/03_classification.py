# # Setup

# First, let's import a few common modules, ensure MatplotLib plots figures inline and prepare a function to save the figures. We also check that Python 3.5 or later is installed (although Python 2.x may work, it is deprecated so we strongly recommend you use Python 3 instead), as well as Scikit-Learn ≥0.20.

# Python ≥3.5 is required

# **Warning**: this output (and many others in this notebook and other notebooks) may differ slightly from those in the book. Don't worry, that's okay! There are several reasons for this:
# * first, Scikit-Learn and other libraries evolve, and algorithms get tweaked a bit, which may change the exact result you get. If you use the latest Scikit-Learn version (and in general, you really should), you probably won't be using the exact same version I used when I wrote the book or this notebook, hence the difference. I try to keep this notebook reasonably up to date, but I can't change the numbers on the pages in your copy of the book.
# * second, many training algorithms are stochastic, meaning they rely on randomness. In principle, it's possible to get consistent outputs from a random number generator by setting the seed from which it generates the pseudo-random numbers (which is why you will see `random_state=42` or `np.random.seed(42)` pretty often). However, sometimes this does not suffice due to the other factors listed here.
# * third, if the training algorithm runs across multiple threads (as do some algorithms implemented in C) or across multiple processes (e.g., when using the `n_jobs` argument), then the precise order in which operations will run is not always guaranteed, and thus the exact result may vary slightly.
# * lastly, other things may prevent perfect reproducibility, such as Python maps and sets whose order is not guaranteed to be stable across sessions, or the order of files in a directory which is also not guaranteed.

# First, login to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and go to the [Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to download `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Save them to the `datasets/titanic` directory.
# Next, let's load the data:

import os

TITANIC_PATH = os.path.join("datasets", "titanic")

import pandas as pd

def load_titanic_data(filename, titanic_path=TITANIC_PATH):
    csv_path = os.path.join(titanic_path, filename)
    return pd.read_csv(csv_path)

train_data = load_titanic_data("train.csv")
test_data = load_titanic_data("test.csv")


# The data is already split into a training set and a test set. However, the test data does *not* contain the labels: your goal is to train the best model you can using the training data, then make your predictions on the test data and upload them to Kaggle to see your final score.
# Let's take a peek at the top few rows of the training set:

train_data.head()

# The attributes have the following meaning:
# * **Survived**: that's the target, 0 means the passenger did not survive, while 1 means he/she survived.
# * **Pclass**: passenger class.
# * **Name**, **Sex**, **Age**: self-explanatory
# * **SibSp**: how many siblings & spouses of the passenger aboard the Titanic.
# * **Parch**: how many children & parents of the passenger aboard the Titanic.
# * **Ticket**: ticket id
# * **Fare**: price paid (in pounds)
# * **Cabin**: passenger's cabin number
# * **Embarked**: where the passenger embarked the Titanic

# Let's get more info to see how much data is missing:

train_data.info()

# Okay, the **Age**, **Cabin** and **Embarked** attributes are sometimes null (less than 891 non-null), especially the **Cabin** (77% are null). We will ignore the **Cabin** for now and focus on the rest. The **Age** attribute has about 19% null values, so we will need to decide what to do with them. Replacing null values with the median age seems reasonable.
# The **Name** and **Ticket** attributes may have some value, but they will be a bit tricky to convert into useful numbers that a model can consume. So for now, we will ignore them.
# Let's take a look at the numerical attributes:

train_data.describe()

# * Yikes, only 38% **Survived**. :(  That's close enough to 40%, so accuracy will be a reasonable metric to evaluate our model.
# * The mean **Fare** was £32.20, which does not seem so expensive (but it was probably a lot of money back then).
# * The mean **Age** was less than 30 years old.

# Let's check that the target is indeed 0 or 1:

train_data["Survived"].value_counts()

# Now let's take a quick look at all the categorical attributes:
train_data["Pclass"].value_counts()
train_data["Sex"].value_counts()
train_data["Embarked"].value_counts()


# The Embarked attribute tells us where the passenger embarked: C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton.
# **Note**: the code below uses a mix of `Pipeline`, `FeatureUnion` and a custom `DataFrameSelector` to preprocess some columns differently.  Since Scikit-Learn 0.20, it is preferable to use a `ColumnTransformer`, like in the previous chapter.
# Now let's build our preprocessing pipelines. We will reuse the `DataframeSelector` we built in the previous chapter to select specific attributes from the `DataFrame`:

from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin

class DataFrameSelector(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, attribute_names):
        self.attribute_names = attribute_names
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self
    def transform(self, X):
        return X[self.attribute_names]

from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

num_pipeline = Pipeline([
        ("select_numeric", DataFrameSelector(["Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare"])),
        ("imputer", SimpleImputer(strategy="median")),
    ])

num_pipeline.fit_transform(train_data)


# We will also need an imputer for the string categorical columns (the regular `SimpleImputer` does not work on those):
# Inspired from stackoverflow.com/questions/25239958
class MostFrequentImputer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        self.most_frequent_ = pd.Series([X[c].value_counts().index[0] for c in X],
                                        index=X.columns)
        return self
    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        return X.fillna(self.most_frequent_)

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Now we can build the pipeline for the categorical attributes:
cat_pipeline = Pipeline([
        ("select_cat", DataFrameSelector(["Pclass", "Sex", "Embarked"])),
        ("imputer", MostFrequentImputer()),
        ("cat_encoder", OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)),
    ])

cat_pipeline.fit_transform(train_data)

# Finally, let's join the numerical and categorical pipelines:

from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion
preprocess_pipeline = FeatureUnion(transformer_list=[
        ("num_pipeline", num_pipeline),
        ("cat_pipeline", cat_pipeline),
    ])

# Cool! Now we have a nice preprocessing pipeline that takes the raw data and outputs numerical input features that we can feed to any Machine Learning model we want.
X_train = preprocess_pipeline.fit_transform(train_data)
X_train

# Let's not forget to get the labels:
y_train = train_data["Survived"]

# We are now ready to train a classifier. Let's start with an `SVC`:
from sklearn.svm import SVC

svm_clf = SVC(gamma="auto")
svm_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Great, our model is trained, let's use it to make predictions on the test set:
X_test = preprocess_pipeline.transform(test_data)
y_pred = svm_clf.predict(X_test)

# And now we could just build a CSV file with these predictions (respecting the format excepted by Kaggle), then upload it and hope for the best. But wait! We can do better than hope. Why don't we use cross-validation to have an idea of how good our model is?
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

svm_scores = cross_val_score(svm_clf, X_train, y_train, cv=10)
svm_scores.mean()

# Okay, over 73% accuracy, clearly better than random chance, but it's not a great score. Looking at the [leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/leaderboard) for the Titanic competition on Kaggle, you can see that you need to reach above 80% accuracy to be within the top 10% Kagglers. Some reached 100%, but since you can easily find the [list of victims](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victims/) of the Titanic, it seems likely that there was little Machine Learning involved in their performance! ;-) So let's try to build a model that reaches 80% accuracy.
# Let's try a `RandomForestClassifier`:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

forest_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
forest_scores = cross_val_score(forest_clf, X_train, y_train, cv=10)
forest_scores.mean()

# That's much better!
# Instead of just looking at the mean accuracy across the 10 cross-validation folds, let's plot all 10 scores for each model, along with a box plot highlighting the lower and upper quartiles, and "whiskers" showing the extent of the scores (thanks to Nevin Yilmaz for suggesting this visualization). Note that the `boxplot()` function detects outliers (called "fliers") and does not include them within the whiskers. Specifically, if the lower quartile is $Q_1$ and the upper quartile is $Q_3$, then the interquartile range $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$ (this is the box's height), and any score lower than $Q_1 - 1.5 \times IQR$ is a flier, and so is any score greater than $Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR$.

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot([1]*10, svm_scores, ".")
plt.plot([2]*10, forest_scores, ".")
plt.boxplot([svm_scores, forest_scores], labels=("SVM","Random Forest"))
plt.ylabel("Accuracy", fontsize=14)
plt.show()

# To improve this result further, you could:
# * Compare many more models and tune hyperparameters using cross validation and grid search,
# * Do more feature engineering, for example:
#   * replace **SibSp** and **Parch** with their sum,
#   * try to identify parts of names that correlate well with the **Survived** attribute (e.g. if the name contains "Countess", then survival seems more likely),
# * try to convert numerical attributes to categorical attributes: for example, different age groups had very different survival rates (see below), so it may help to create an age bucket category and use it instead of the age. Similarly, it may be useful to have a special category for people traveling alone since only 30% of them survived (see below).

train_data["AgeBucket"] = train_data["Age"] // 15 * 15
train_data[["AgeBucket", "Survived"]].groupby(['AgeBucket']).mean()

train_data["RelativesOnboard"] = train_data["SibSp"] + train_data["Parch"]
train_data[["RelativesOnboard", "Survived"]].groupby(['RelativesOnboard']).mean()

# ## 4. Spam classifier
# First, let's fetch the data:

import os
import tarfile
import urllib

DOWNLOAD_ROOT = "http://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/"
HAM_URL = DOWNLOAD_ROOT + "20030228_easy_ham.tar.bz2"
SPAM_URL = DOWNLOAD_ROOT + "20030228_spam.tar.bz2"
SPAM_PATH = os.path.join("datasets", "spam")

def fetch_spam_data(spam_url=SPAM_URL, spam_path=SPAM_PATH):
    if not os.path.isdir(spam_path):
        os.makedirs(spam_path)
    for filename, url in (("ham.tar.bz2", HAM_URL), ("spam.tar.bz2", SPAM_URL)):
        path = os.path.join(spam_path, filename)
        if not os.path.isfile(path):
            urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, path)
        tar_bz2_file = tarfile.open(path)
        tar_bz2_file.extractall(path=SPAM_PATH)
        tar_bz2_file.close()

fetch_spam_data()

# Next, let's load all the emails:

HAM_DIR = os.path.join(SPAM_PATH, "easy_ham")
SPAM_DIR = os.path.join(SPAM_PATH, "spam")
ham_filenames = [name for name in sorted(os.listdir(HAM_DIR)) if len(name) > 20]
spam_filenames = [name for name in sorted(os.listdir(SPAM_DIR)) if len(name) > 20]

len(ham_filenames)
len(spam_filenames)

# We can use Python's `email` module to parse these emails (this handles headers, encoding, and so on):

import email
import email.policy

def load_email(is_spam, filename, spam_path=SPAM_PATH):
    directory = "spam" if is_spam else "easy_ham"
    with open(os.path.join(spam_path, directory, filename), "rb") as f:
        return email.parser.BytesParser(policy=email.policy.default).parse(f)

ham_emails = [load_email(is_spam=False, filename=name) for name in ham_filenames]
spam_emails = [load_email(is_spam=True, filename=name) for name in spam_filenames]


# Let's look at one example of ham and one example of spam, to get a feel of what the data looks like:
print(ham_emails[1].get_content().strip())
print(spam_emails[6].get_content().strip())

# Some emails are actually multipart, with images and attachments (which can have their own attachments). Let's look at the various types of structures we have:

def get_email_structure(email):
    if isinstance(email, str):
        return email
    payload = email.get_payload()
    if isinstance(payload, list):
        return "multipart({})".format(", ".join([
            get_email_structure(sub_email)
            for sub_email in payload
        ]))
    else:
        return email.get_content_type()

from collections import Counter

def structures_counter(emails):
    structures = Counter()
    for email in emails:
        structure = get_email_structure(email)
        structures[structure] += 1
    return structures

structures_counter(ham_emails).most_common()
structures_counter(spam_emails).most_common()

# It seems that the ham emails are more often plain text, while spam has quite a lot of HTML. Moreover, quite a few ham emails are signed using PGP, while no spam is. In short, it seems that the email structure is useful information to have.
# Now let's take a look at the email headers:

for header, value in spam_emails[0].items():
    print(header,":",value)

# There's probably a lot of useful information in there, such as the sender's email address (12a1mailbot1@web.de looks fishy), but we will just focus on the `Subject` header:
spam_emails[0]["Subject"]

# Okay, before we learn too much about the data, let's not forget to split it into a training set and a test set:

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = np.array(ham_emails + spam_emails, dtype=object)
y = np.array([0] * len(ham_emails) + [1] * len(spam_emails))

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# Okay, let's start writing the preprocessing functions. First, we will need a function to convert HTML to plain text. Arguably the best way to do this would be to use the great [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library, but I would like to avoid adding another dependency to this project, so let's hack a quick & dirty solution using regular expressions (at the risk of [un̨ho͞ly radiańcé destro҉ying all enli̍̈́̂̈́ghtenment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/38626)). The following function first drops the `<head>` section, then converts all `<a>` tags to the word HYPERLINK, then it gets rid of all HTML tags, leaving only the plain text. For readability, it also replaces multiple newlines with single newlines, and finally it unescapes html entities (such as `&gt;` or `&nbsp;`):

import re
from html import unescape

def html_to_plain_text(html):
    text = re.sub('<head.*?>.*?</head>', '', html, flags=re.M | re.S | re.I)
    text = re.sub('<a\s.*?>', ' HYPERLINK ', text, flags=re.M | re.S | re.I)
    text = re.sub('<.*?>', '', text, flags=re.M | re.S)
    text = re.sub(r'(\s*\n)+', '\n', text, flags=re.M | re.S)
    return unescape(text)


# Let's see if it works. This is HTML spam:

html_spam_emails = [email for email in X_train[y_train==1]
                    if get_email_structure(email) == "text/html"]
sample_html_spam = html_spam_emails[7]
print(sample_html_spam.get_content().strip()[:1000], "...")

# And this is the resulting plain text:
print(html_to_plain_text(sample_html_spam.get_content())[:1000], "...")

# Great! Now let's write a function that takes an email as input and returns its content as plain text, whatever its format is:

def email_to_text(email):
    html = None
    for part in email.walk():
        ctype = part.get_content_type()
        if not ctype in ("text/plain", "text/html"):
            continue
        try:
            content = part.get_content()
        except: # in case of encoding issues
            content = str(part.get_payload())
        if ctype == "text/plain":
            return content
        else:
            html = content
    if html:
        return html_to_plain_text(html)

print(email_to_text(sample_html_spam)[:100], "...")


# Let's throw in some stemming! For this to work, you need to install the Natural Language Toolkit ([NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)). It's as simple as running the following command (don't forget to activate your virtualenv first; if you don't have one, you will likely need administrator rights, or use the `--user` option):
# 
# `$ pip3 install nltk`

try:
    import nltk

    stemmer = nltk.PorterStemmer()
    for word in ("Computations", "Computation", "Computing", "Computed", "Compute", "Compulsive"):
        print(word, "=>", stemmer.stem(word))
except ImportError:
    print("Error: stemming requires the NLTK module.")
    stemmer = None


# We will also need a way to replace URLs with the word "URL". For this, we could use hard core [regular expressions](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex) but we will just use the [urlextract](https://github.com/lipoja/URLExtract) library. You can install it with the following command (don't forget to activate your virtualenv first; if you don't have one, you will likely need administrator rights, or use the `--user` option):
# 
# `$ pip3 install urlextract`

# if running this notebook on Colab, we just pip install urlextract
try:
    import google.colab
    get_ipython().system('pip install -q -U urlextract')
except ImportError:
    pass # not running on Colab

try:
    import urlextract # may require an Internet connection to download root domain names
    
    url_extractor = urlextract.URLExtract()
    print(url_extractor.find_urls("Will it detect github.com and https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?t=3m32s"))
except ImportError:
    print("Error: replacing URLs requires the urlextract module.")
    url_extractor = None


# We are ready to put all this together into a transformer that we will use to convert emails to word counters. Note that we split sentences into words using Python's `split()` method, which uses whitespaces for word boundaries. This works for many written languages, but not all. For example, Chinese and Japanese scripts generally don't use spaces between words, and Vietnamese often uses spaces even between syllables. It's okay in this exercise, because the dataset is (mostly) in English.

# Now we have the word counts, and we need to convert them to vectors. For this, we will build another transformer whose `fit()` method will build the vocabulary (an ordered list of the most common words) and whose `transform()` method will use the vocabulary to convert word counts to vectors. The output is a sparse matrix.

# Over 98.5%, not bad for a first try! :) However, remember that we are using the "easy" dataset. You can try with the harder datasets, the results won't be so amazing. You would have to try multiple models, select the best ones and fine-tune them using cross-validation, and so on.
# 
# But you get the picture, so let's stop now, and just print out the precision/recall we get on the test set:
