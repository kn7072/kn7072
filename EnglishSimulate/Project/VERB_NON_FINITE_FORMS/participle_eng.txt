305. 	She felt the tears blinding her eyes and looked away, trying to hide her emotions.
306. 	Are you going to spend your life saying "ought", like the rest of our moralists?
307. 	The man was found grovelling on the floor.
308. 	The old woman was heard shrieking in short bursts like a ship in a fog.
309. 	When the door closed, Mike and I were left looking at each other.
310. 	I felt I had been caught boasting.
311. 	About that time the hurricane was reported tramping its way out in our direction.
312. 	One afternoon in August I saw something that surprised me and set me thinking.
313. 	He looked at Jane wiping her tear-wet face.
314. 	I pictured myself sitting by his bed, nursing him.
315. 	Sitting idly at his desk, he puffed away at a cigar and watched, the blue smoke curling.
316. 	Arriving he found me reading "Tom Jones".
317. 	Just as I got to the end of the corridor, I heard my telephone ringing again.

323. 	I made to go out, but Roger, browning, shook his head.
324. 	Knowing he could not go to Alice, he tried to telephone her.
325. 	Seeing their discomfort, Mrs. Ape softened and smiled.

329. 	Often, when boasting of his deceits, he sounded childlike and innocent.
330. 	She lacked the courage to drop cosmetics altogether when going out with Keith.
331. 	He listened, as though brooding.
332. 	She stopped speaking, as though waiting for him to speak.
333. 	Himself a man of no education, though possessing remarkaÂ­ble wit, he placed little value on book knowledge.
334. 	He always stopped if passing on a wet night, and sniffed and enjoyed that skunk smell.
335. 	So taking all things into consideration, I decided to tear the article up.
