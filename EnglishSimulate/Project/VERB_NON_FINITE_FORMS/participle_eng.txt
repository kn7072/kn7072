307. 	The man was found grovelling on the floor.
308. 	The old woman was heard shrieking in short bursts like a ship in a fog.
309. 	When the door closed, Mike and I were left looking at each other.
310. 	I felt I had been caught boasting.

312. 	One afternoon in August I saw something that surprised me and set me thinking.
313. 	He looked at Jane wiping her tear-wet face.
314. 	I pictured myself sitting by his bed, nursing him.
315. 	Sitting idly at his desk, he puffed away at a cigar and watched, the blue smoke curling.

330. 	She lacked the courage to drop cosmetics altogether when going out with Keith.
331. 	He listened, as though brooding.
332. 	She stopped speaking, as though waiting for him to speak.
333. 	Himself a man of no education, though possessing remarka­ble wit, he placed little value on book knowledge.
334. 	He always stopped if passing on a wet night, and sniffed and enjoyed that skunk smell.
335. 	So taking all things into consideration, I decided to tear the article up.
